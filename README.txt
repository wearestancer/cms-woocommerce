== The ideal payment solution for your WooCommerce shop ==

= Accept a multitude of payment methods =

The Stancer module for WooCommerce allows you to accept the most common payment methods used by your customers such as credit cards, classic or instant SEPA transfers, or SEPA direct debits, to collect them from your WooCommerce merchant site.

In order to make the shopping experience smoother, customers have the possibility to register a credit card during the checkout process in order to quickly pay their next purchases.


= Easy integration =

To integrate our solution on your WooCommerce website, you must [create a Stancer account](https://manage.stancer.com/en/sign-up).

After your account has been validated by our team, you will be able to opt for the different integration modes available:

1. Via a Stancer pop-in integrated on your merchant site:
    When the customer clicks on "Order", the Stancer payment module pop-in opens on the page of your site and allows the customer to enter their bank details.
2. Via a redirection:
    After clicking on "Checkout", the user automatically leaves your merchant site and is directed to a Stancer payment page. Once the payment has been accepted, the user is redirected to the order confirmation page of your shop site.

= Guarantee the security of your payments =

Secure transactions enhance your website's reputation and help your business grow. This is why we have set up robust and reliable protection systems to protect you from fraud attempts.

Payments are 3D-Secure compatible. The amount at which the 3D-Secure is adjustable from the back-office module in WooCommerce.


= A dashboard to follow your activity =

In the search field type "Stancer", you will see the plugin. You can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.
The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Updates are done automatically. However, we recommend that you back up your site before each update.
